A library to supply sequential or random objects within the given range and repeats

## Features

- The base class DataWalker supplies sequential or random indices based on the length and repeat count
- Derived classes supply sequential or random objects (date/times, ints, nums, iterables) mapped to the indices generated by the base class
- Sequential or random strings can be generated using a list of strings. The random ones also delivered by another package: random_unicode.

## Usage

The working example which can also be found in the repository in `example/data_walker_example.dart`

```dart
import 'package:data_walker/data_walker.dart';

/// Main entry point for the example
///
void main() {
  final list = ['Str11', 'Str22', 'Str33'];

  var lw = ListWalker(list, repeats: 2, isRandom: false);

  print('\n*** Sequential ***\n');

  while (lw.repeatNo < lw.repeats) {
    print('Next: ${lw.next()}, no: ${lw.currentNo}, rpt: ${lw.repeatNo}');
  }

  print('\n*** Random ***\n');

  lw = ListWalker(list, repeats: 10, isRandom: true);

  while (lw.repeatNo < lw.repeats) {
    print('Next: ${lw.next()}, no: ${lw.currentNo}, rpt: ${lw.repeatNo}');
  }
}
```
